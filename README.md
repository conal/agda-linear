## Denotative linear algebra in Agda

A continuation of [linalg](https://github.com/conal/linalg), shifting from Haskell to Agda.
Motivation for this change includes getting full checking of homomorphisms (linearity itself and the "semantic homomorphisms").

The classes in `Category.agda` are adapted from [calculating-compilers-agda](https://github.com/conal/calculating-compilers-agda).

Early work in progress by Agda newbies.
Comments most welcome!
